Given the root of a binary tree,
Return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.

1. Create a queue of nodes
2. Create a class with 2 members, node and level
3. Add the root in the Queue with level = 0
4. Create a Map<Level, list of nodes>
5. Apply BFS:
    while (queue is not empty)
        pop the node,level object
        if map has level:
            append node to the map.get(level) list
        else
            map.put(level, node)
        Offer all current children of node to queue.
6. Create a List<List<Integer>> from the map and return
