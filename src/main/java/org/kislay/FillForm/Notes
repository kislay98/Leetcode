An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image.You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color.
You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

1. create a visited matrix
2. use DFS or BFS with start as sr,sc
    if (r,c) are not in range OR grid != originalColor
        return
    visited[i][j] = true
    DFS(up, down, left, right)
    grid[i][j] = newColor
3.  return image
