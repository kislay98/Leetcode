Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.


1. Create a m x n distance matrix  and a m x n boolean visited matrix
2. Put all zero's position in a queue, mark their distance as 0, and visited = true
3. [EDGE CASE] No zeros: return  matrix with all distance = 0
4. APPLY BFS,
    while queue is not empty,
        pop an element from the queue
        for each of its 4 neighbour
            if not visited:
                put in queue
                mark them as visited
                update distance(neighbour) = distance(element) + 1



JAVA SYNTAX TO REMEMBER:
       1. Queue<DATATYPE> queue = new LinkedList<DATATYPE>();
       2. No Pair in java.util, use int[] arr OR Map<Integer, Integer> map
